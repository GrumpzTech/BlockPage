    <h3><b>This site was started on October 22'nd 2020, however the design
        wasn't finished enough for launch until October 28'th 2020.</b></h3>
    <h3><b>The site was started after my friend PF94 said he wanted a bunch of
        2003page clones/alternatives, well i wouldn't really call this a clone,
        i would call it an alternative</b></h3>
    <h3><b>The homepage was made using Bootstrap, and modified by Grumpz (me.)</b></h3>
    <h3><b>This site is mainly targeted towards Blockland players, but really
        anyone can join.</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Originally this site's homepage was just a barely modified (title and
        images were modded) Bootstrap template, later on (the same or next day
        after it was started) I added insults to myself telling me i need to
        finish the site, those only lasted less than 24 hours, the next day,
        they were removed and replaced with placeholders.</b></h3>
    <h3><b>This site's domain is hosted by Upwader (look him up on GitHub if you
        are interested), hence the blockpage.upwader.com domain, originally this
        site was still using the old grumpztech.github.io/BlockPage/ domain,
        which now just redirects to the new domain which then goes to the site.</b></h3>
